## Course 1: Introduction to ML Life Cycle and Deployment

### Week 1: Overview of the ML Lifecycle and Deployment

| Depolyment Patterns | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Shadow mode | Have a machine learning algorithm shadow the human inspector and run parallel with the human inspector. The learning algorithms output is not used for any decision.
| Canary | Roll out to a small fraction of traffic. Then either gradually ramp up (if it’s going well) or rollback (if not) 
| Blue green | Assign traffic to a green (new) deployment from a blue (old) deployment

**Degree of automation**

Human only -> Shadow mode -> AI assistance -> Partial automatio -> Full automation 

**Model monitoring**

| Type of Metrics | Metric Examples | 
| -- | -- | 
| Software | Memory, compute, latency, throughput, server load | 
| Input | Avg input lenght, avg input volume, Num missing values, Avg image brightness
| Output | # times retrun "" (null), # times user redoes search, # times user switch to typing, CTR


### Week 2: Select and Train a Model

**How to establish a baseline?**

- Human level performance (HLP). Generally it's more effective for establishing the baseline on unstructured data than structured data. 
- Literature search for state-of-the-art/open source
- Older system

| Metric | Formula | Layman definition 1 | Layman definition 2| 
| -- | -- | -- | -- | 
| Precision | $\frac{TP}{TP + FP}$ | TP / **Predicted** positive | How believable the model is when it says an instance is a positive?
| Recal | $\frac{TP}{TP + FN}$ | TP / **Real** positive | How often was the model able to find positives?

### Week 3: Data Labeling

**What are the differences between structured and unstructured data in terms of labeling and data augmentation?** 

> It is generally easier for humans to label data and to apply data augmentation on unstructured data than structured data.

**What is data provenance and data lineage? Why we need them?**

> - Data provenance: where the data comes from? 
> - Data lineage: sequence of steps
> - Tools: extensive documention, tensorflow transform
